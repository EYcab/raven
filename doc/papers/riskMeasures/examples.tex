\section{Test Examples}
\label{sec:test}

In this section we present few examples that will help the reader to understand 
how this method can be applied to fairly common cases.

\subsection{Example 1: series/parallel configuration}
\label{sec:example1}

The first example consists of 3 components 
arranged in a series/parallel configuration as shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:example12}. 
In this case the following probabilities of failures (on-demand) are provided:
\begin{itemize}
  \item $p_A = 1.0 10^{-2}$
  \item $p_B = 5.0 10^{-2}$
  \item $p_C = 1.0 10^{-1}$
\end{itemize}

    \caption{System considered for Examples 1 and 2.}
    \label{fig:example12}
\end{figure}
  
From a RISMC (i.e., dynamic PRA) point of view the analysis of this system is performed as follows 
(see Section~\ref{sec:analogy}):
\begin{itemize}
  \item Define 3 stochastic parameters (i.e., $S=3$):
    \begin{itemize}
      \item $s_1$: status of component A
      \item $s_2$: status of component B
      \item $s_3$: status of component C
    \end{itemize}
  \item Assign a distribution to each stochastic parameter; in this case a Bernoulli 
        distribution  
  \item Define $I_i^+$ and $I_i^-$ for each distribution: in this case we have chosen 
        $I_i^-=[0.0,0.1]$ and $I_i^+=[1.0,1.1]$ 
  \item Generate $N$ samples, for example by employing Monte-Carlo or Grid sampling strategies
  \item Determine $R_0$, $R_i^-$ and $R_i^+$ for each component 
  \item Determine the desired RIMs for each component
\end{itemize}

Note that a Monte-Carlo sampling is not the best sampling strategy in terms of computational 
costs. This is even more relevant if the value of $p_A$, $p_B$ or $p_C$ were several order of 
magnitude lower. 

A more effective sampling strategy would be the Grid sampling (see Section~\ref{sec:analogy}): 
the stochastic variables 
are sampled over a fixed Cartesian grid and a probability weight is associated to each sample. 
In this case, each stochastic variable $s_i$ is sampled over two values, 0.0 and 1.0, and the 
probability weights $w_i^0$ and $w_i^1$ values associated to each sample coordinate are:
\begin{itemize}
  \item $s_i=0.0$: $w_i^0=prob(s_i \in [-\infty,0.5])$
  \item $s_i=1.0$: $w_i^1=prob(s_i \in [0.5,+\infty])$
\end{itemize}
Following this grid sampling strategy, only $2^3=8$ are needed.
Below, the FV and RAW importance values for all three components obtained by RAVEN (using a Grid sampling 
strategy) are shown compared with the analytical ones.

% \subsection{Example 2: Time-dependent system}
% \label{sec:example2}
% 
% The second example is similar to Example I but with different reliability data: 
% a failure rate is provided for each component (mission time: 24 hours): 
% \begin{itemize}
%   \item $\lambda_A = 1.0 10^{-3} hr^{-1}$
%   \item $\lambda_B = 5.0 10^{-3} hr^{-1}$
%   \item $\lambda_C = 1.0 10^{-2} hr^{-1}$
% \end{itemize}
% Thus it is assumed that failure probability of each component is exponentially 
% distributed: sampled value $s_i$ from its own distribution is failure time of each 
% component ($t_A$, $t_B$ and $t_C$).
% In this case, $I_i^+$ and $I_i^-$ can be defined as follows:
% \begin{itemize}
%   \item $I_i^-=[24.0,+\infty]$: component is considered perfectly reliable if the failure 
%         time is greater than the mission time
%   \item $I_i^+=[0.0,1.0]$: component is considered unreliable if the failure time 
%         occurs within the first hour
% \end{itemize}
% 
% As shown for Example I, a Grid sampling strategy has been employed. Table~\ref{} shows the 
% FV importance for all three components obtained by RAVEN (using a Grid sampling strategy) 
% compared with the analytical ones.

%     $FV_B$ & 0.4983  & 0.4983   \\
%     $FV_C$ & 0.4983  & 0.4983   \\

\subsection{Example 2: time-dependent stand-by configuration}
\label{sec:example2}

The second example considers a simplified ECCS model (see Fig.~\ref{}) of a reactor. 
It consists of the following components and for a subset of them a 
value of mean time to failure (MTTF) is provided:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Motor-operate valve M (MTTF = 24 h, $\lambda_{valve} = 0.041667$)
  \item Two redundant pumps, pump1 and pump2 
        (MTTF = 12 h, $\lambda_{pump1} = \lambda_{pump2} = 0.083333$)
  \item Heat exchanger HX (reliability = 1.0)
\end{itemize}

Pump1 is normally used while pump2 is on standby. If Pump1 fails then pump2 provide water flow. 
Pump2 cannot fail while in standby. Switch from pump1 to pump2 is perfectly reliable. 
The cooling is such that it takes 2 hours to reach vessel failure condition if the 
M-pump1-pump2 
system has failed. Mission time is again equal to 24 hours.

\end{figure}

Note in this case classical PRA methods require few model simplifications in order to correctly 
determine system reliability.
Below are shown the FV importance for all three components obtained by RAVEN (using a Monte-Carlo 
sampling strategy) compared with the analytical ones.

        $RAW_{pump2}$ & 1.117058099 &   \\
        \hline 
      \end{tabular}
    \end{minipage} 
\end{table}


\subsection{Example 3: $K$ out of $N$ configuration}
\label{sec:example3}

The third example is similar to the one shown in Section~\ref{sec:example2}
It consists of the following components:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Motor-operate valve M (MTTF = 24 h, $\lambda_{valve} = 0.041667$)
  \item Three pumps, pump1, pump2 and pump3 
        (MTTF = 12 h, $\lambda_{pump1} = \lambda_{pump2} = \lambda_{pump3} = 0.083333$)
  \item Heat exchanger HX (reliability = 1.0)
\end{itemize}
All pumps are initially running but 2 out of 3 are required to cool the system.
Mission time is again equal to 24 hours.

sampling strategy) compared with the analytical ones.

\subsection{Example 4: time and physics dependent stand-by configuration}
\label{sec:example4}

The forth example considers the system of Example 2 (see Section~\ref{sec:example2}) but it considers 
also the temporal behavior of the reactor.
The top event is not the failure of valve-pump1-pump2 system but it occurs when core temperature $T$
reaches a threshold value $T_{max}$ (i.e., reactor failure). 
The analysis is perrofmed for two different power levels: 100\% and 120\%.
Mission time is still 24 hours.

Note that the configuration is slightly different from the one presented in the first two 
examples (here a stand-by configuration is introduced) but also the condition of system failure 
is dictated by the dynamic behavior of the PWR.  The system is designed such that a late failure 
of the ECCS may not lead to system failure (i.e., natural circulation is providing enough cooling). 
In other words, the ECCS is vital especially in the hours right after a reactor scram.

In principle, this test case cannot be solved analytically due to the complexity of the reactor behavior.
Practically it can be solve by identifying the time $T_{lim}$ (limit time) after which a failure of the  
valve-pump1-pump2 system does not cause reactor failure.
Note that $T_{lim}$ could only be determined be recursively run the system simulator.
