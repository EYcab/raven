Risk importance measures are indexes that are used to rank systems, 
structures and components (SSCs) using risk-informed methods. 
The most used/known measures are: Risk Reduction Worth (RRW), 
Risk Achievement Worth (RAW), Birnbaum (B) and Fussell-Vesely (FV). 
Once obtained from classical Probabilistic Risk Analysis (PRA) analyses, 
these risk measures can be effectively employed to optimize component 
testing and maintenance. In contrast to classical PRA methods, 
Dynamic PRA methods couple stochastic methods with safety analysis 
codes to determine risk associate to complex systems such as nuclear 
plants. Compared to classical PRA methods, they can evaluate with 
higher resolution the safety impact of timing and sequencing of events 
on the accident progression. The objective of this paper is to present 
a series of algorithms that can be used to determine classical risk 
importance measures (RRW, RAW, B and FV) along with newly developed 
ones from a Dynamic PRA analysis.
