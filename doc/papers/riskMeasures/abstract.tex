Risk importance measures are indexes that are used to rank systems, 
structures and components (SSCs) using risk-informed methods. 
The most used/known measures are: Risk Reduction Worth (RRW), 
Risk Achievement Worth (RAW), Birnbaum (B) and Fussell-Vesely (FV). 
Once obtained from classical Probabilistic Risk Analysis (PRA) analyses, 
these risk measures can be effectively employed to relatively rank
component importance.
In contrast to classical PRA methods, 
Dynamic PRA methods couple stochastic models with safety analysis 
codes to determine risk associate to complex systems such as nuclear 
plants. Compared to classical PRA methods, simulation-based approaches
can evaluate with 
higher resolution the safety impact of timing and sequencing of events 
on the accident progression. 
The objective of this paper is to present a series of methods that 
can be employed to measure risk importance of components which are 
part of complex systems such as nuclear power plants.
The first set of measures are directly derived from classical risk 
importance measures (e.g., RRW, RAW, B and FV) and that can be employed
to any Dynamic PRA analysis.
In addition, we provide a set of risk importance measures that capture the 
dynamic nature of the problem and provide insight related to plant safety 
margins
