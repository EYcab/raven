\section{Conclusions}
\label{sec:conclusions}

This paper has presented a mathematical framework for determining risk 
importance measures in a simulation based, i.e. dynamic, PRA framework. 
We have shown how classical measures can be derived and
we have provided few explanatory examples. We have also indicated how the 
data generation method is important to maximize the amount of 
information generated by each simulation run. Lastly we have presented a novel
set of risk importance measures that are not bounded by a Boolean 
logic but explore the continuity of the problem. The advantage of these measures 
is that they capture the idea of ``safety margin''.
