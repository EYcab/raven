\section{Multi-unit PRA}
\label{sec:multiUnitPRA}

The objective of this analysis is to rank PDSs based on their probability values.
Using a Monte-Carlo [14] sampling strategy we have simulated about 2000 accident scenarios. 
For each simulation run we have performed the following steps:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Sample a value for each stochastic parameter that is part of the set of parameters $p$ (e.g., timing of events)
  \item Performing the actual simulation run given $p$ sampled in Step 1 for each model of the multi-unit plant
  \item Collect the output (OK or CD) from each model and construct the PDS associated to the run
  \item Associate a unique probability value to the PDS accordingly to the chosen sampling
  \item Repeat Steps 1 trough 4, $M$ times 
\end{enumerate}
