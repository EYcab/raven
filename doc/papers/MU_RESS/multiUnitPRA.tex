\section{Multi-unit PRA}
\label{sec:multiUnitPRA}

Given the model described in Section~\ref{sec:RISMC_MU_modeling} and
the stochastic parameters listed in Table~\ref{tab:stochasticParameters} we have 
we have simulated about [???] accident scenarios using RAVEN Monte-Carlo sampling
capabilities. For each simulation, we have collected the output (OK or CD) from 
each model (i.e., all PWRs and SFPs).

The use of ROMs instead of the actual codes allowed us to generate a very large 
database of data which helped us to visualize timing and sequencing of events at 
the unit level.
