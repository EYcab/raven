\section{Plant ROM Modeling}
\label{sec:plantRomModeling}

\newcommand{\DPM}[1]{\textcolor{magenta}{#1}}

For the six plant models considered in this analysis, we have chosen to use
$k$-nearest neighbor classifiers as surrogates to predict the presence
of core damage in each of the models.
%
Each surrogate is trained on a separate set of Monte Carlo samples, and
cross-validated using 3-fold validation in order to select an optimal value for
$k$.
%
In 3-fold validation, the data is split into three subsets and trained on two
of the subsets where the third subset is used to evaluate the prediction
accuracy.
%
The $k$-value that fits the data with the highest accuracy is considered the
``best'' parameter setting.
%
We repeat this process ten times for each model to ensure stability of the
results using multiples of 5 up to 50 for values of $k$ ($\[5,10,15,20,25,30,35,40,45,50\]$).

We evaluate the convergence of each rom by evaluating the mean and standard
deviation of the prediction accuracy over various training sizes, where a subset
of the training data is used to construct a surrogate which is then used to
predict on the entire validation set.
%
An example of this convergence is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:romConvergence}.

The resulting $k$ values used for each model are reported in Table~\ref{tab:romInfo}.
