Historically the concept of core damage (CD) probability has been typically 
associated to a single unit. At a plant level, a separate value of CD 
probability can be associated to all PWRs and SFPs. However, note that there 
is a high correlation among the six models of the plant (PWRs and SFPs). 
Thus it is also expected that a high correlation among CD probabilities among 
the six models.

Thus, instead of defining a single CD probability value for each PWR and SFP 
we define a probability value to a Plant Damage State (PDS) variable. This 
variable is a $6$-dimensional vector where each vector element describes the 
status of a plant model. For the scope of this paper we allowed two possible 
values for each element of the vector: OK or CD. Hence $2^6=64$ possible 
combinations are allowed.

Group simulation runs based on their own PDS and evaluate probability associated 
to each of the 64 allowed PDSs.

The objective of this analysis is to rank PDSs based on their 
probability values.
