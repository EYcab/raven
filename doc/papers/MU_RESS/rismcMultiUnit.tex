\section{RISMC approach to multi-unit modeling}
\label{sec:RISMC_MU_modeling}

This section shows in detail how the actual multi-unit model has been implemented
using RAVEN and RELAP5-3D.

\subsection{Plant Model}
The plant model has been coded as a Python script and interfaced with RAVEN as an 
external model. Its main purpose is to determine timing and sequencing of events 
for all six system models (i.e., PWRs and SFPs) given the sampled values of the 
stochastic parameters.

\subsection{Plant Stochastic Modeling}
We have identified 23 stochastic parameters 

A summary of the chosen stochastic parameters are listed in Table~\ref{tab:stochasticParameters} 
along a description and with their probabilistic distribution.
