\section{Conclusions}
\label{sec:conclusions}

In this paper we have presented a first step toward a simulation-based approach to analyze 
multi-unit plants. We have described the basic method to perform both deterministic and 
stochastic modeling of a generic multi-unit plant by employing RAVEN and RELAP5-3D codes. 
We have presented a preliminary set of results that have been generated by employing high 
performance computing systems due to high computational time of each simulation run and due 
to the high number of simulation runs requested. We have shown that more quantitative analysis 
details can be obtained from this kind of approach.
We want to highlight again how this paper represents a first phase toward the modeling of 
very complex systems such as multi-unit plants. Research directions we are now following 
include the use of surrogate models in order to decrease the computational costs of the analysis 
and interface Dynamic PRA results with classical PRA methods.
