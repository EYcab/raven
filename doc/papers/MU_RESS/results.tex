\section{Results}

We performed a first preliminary analysis of this multi-unit model using a Monte-Carlo sampling. 
We have generated about 2000 simulation runs.  This limited number of simulations cannot be considered 
a sufficient statistial population and, hence, the reuslts obtained can only be considered as preliminary.
A summary of the six more relevant (from a probabilistc point of view) PDSs are shown in Table 2. 
Given the initiaiting event, there is a probability euqal to 21.6 E-3 that the plant at least one model 
will reach a CD situation. In particular, the PWRs of units 2 and 3 are the more sensistive to reach a 
damaged condition. For the PWR of unit 2, the involunatry alignment of the EDGS is the most important 
factor for reaching CD condtion.
Note that a PDS that includes more than one model in a CD condition is the PDS number 5 where both the 
PWRs of units 2 and 3 are damaged.
The SFPs can tolerate lasrge time in a SBO condition, however a break in the SFP quickly accelerates 
the heatup process. In this case the first PDS that incldues a CD condtion in a SFP is the 6th PDS.
