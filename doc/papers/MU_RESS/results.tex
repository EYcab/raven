\section{Results}

A summary of the six more relevant (from a probabilistic point of view) PDSs are shown in Table 2. 
Given the initiating event, there is a probability equal to 21.6 E-3 that the plant at least one model 
will reach a CD situation. In particular, the PWRs of units 2 and 3 are the more sensitive to reach a 
damaged condition. For the PWR of unit 2, the involuntary alignment of the EDGS is the most important 
factor for reaching CD condition.
Note that a PDS that includes more than one model in a CD condition is the PDS number 5 where both the 
PWRs of units 2 and 3 are damaged.
The SFPs can tolerate large time in a SBO condition, however a break in the SFP quickly accelerates 
the heatup process. In this case the first PDS that includes a CD condition in a SFP is the 6th PDS.
