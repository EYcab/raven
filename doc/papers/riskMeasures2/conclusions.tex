\section{Conclusions}
\label{sec:conclusions}

In this paper we have investigated a detailed comparison between Classical and Dynamic PRA methods.
The considered system has been a 3-loop PWR under an LB-LOCA initiating event.
We have used several metrics to quantify this comparison ranging from CD probability to event 
sequence probabilities and basic event risk importance measures.
We have described the process of comparison and how the model data has been shared between the PRA
approaches.
The outcome of the comparison highlighted limitations of classical PRA methods in terms of modeling
accident sequences due to conservative modeling assumptions and success criteria.
